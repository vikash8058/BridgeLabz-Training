# Week 6: Java 8 features

## 📅 Day 1 – Lambda Expression, Functional Interface, Method reference and Marker Interface
**(Date: 27-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Functional Programming Enhancements in Java 8)**

- > Studied Java 8 functional programming concepts to write cleaner, more expressive, and efficient Java code.

- > Learned Lambda Expressions to reduce boilerplate code and implement functional interfaces in a concise manner.

- > Explored Functional Interfaces such as Runnable, Callable, Comparator, and custom functional interfaces using @FunctionalInterface.

- > Practiced Method References (static, instance, and constructor references) to improve readability and reuse existing methods.

- > Understood the concept of Marker Interfaces and how they provide metadata to the JVM without defining methods.

- > Applied Java 8 features in practical examples to simplify logic, improve maintainability, and follow modern Java coding standards.

- > Focused on building a strong foundation for Streams API, collections processing, and functional-style programming.

## 📅 Day 2 – Java 8 Streams API
** (Date: 28-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Data Processing with Streams, forEach & Collectors)**

- > Studied the Java 8 Streams API to process collections in a declarative and functional style.

- > Learned how streams work as a pipeline consisting of source, intermediate operations, and terminal operations.

- > Explored the forEach() method to iterate over collections and streams using lambda expressions.

- > Practiced intermediate operations such as filter(), map(), sorted(), and distinct() for data transformation.

- > Understood Collectors and their role in collecting stream results into lists, sets, maps, and grouped data.

- > Worked with commonly used collectors like toList(), toSet(), toMap(), groupingBy(), and counting().

- > Focused on writing clean, readable, and efficient code using functional programming concepts in Java 8.

Smart City Transport & Service Management System

Applied these concepts in the Smart City Transport System to filter schedules, display live services, and analyze passenger trips using Streams and Collectors.
Focused on writing clean, readable, and efficient functional-style Java 8 code for real-world scenarios.
