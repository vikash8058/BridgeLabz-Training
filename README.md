## 📅 Day 4 – Java: Exception Handling
**(Date: 20-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Handling Runtime Errors and Building Robust Applications)**

- > Studied Java Exception Handling to manage runtime errors and prevent abnormal program termination.

- > Learned the use of try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords for controlled error handling.

- > Explored checked vs unchecked exceptions and common exceptions like NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, and IOException.

- > Practiced creating and using custom exceptions for application-specific error scenarios.

- > Focused on writing robust, readable, and maintainable code with proper exception-handling best practices.
