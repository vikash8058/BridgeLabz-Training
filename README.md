## 📅 Day 15 – Data Structures & Algorithms: Linked List
**(Date: 02-01-2026)**
**(Focus: DSA Fundamentals – Linked List Variants)**

- > Learned the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and their importance in efficient problem-solving.

- > Understood how data structures help in organizing and managing data for optimized performance.

- > Studied Linked List as a dynamic linear data structure that uses nodes instead of contiguous memory.
  
- > Learned the structure of a node containing data and references (links).

- > Explored different types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List – traversal in one direction using next reference.

Doubly Linked List – traversal in both directions using previous and next references.

Circular Linked List – last node links back to the first node forming a loop.

- > Practiced implementing Linked Lists using Java classes and pointer-based logic.

- > Gained clarity on insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching operations.

- > Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured DSA-based code.

- > Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

- > Organized all Linked List programs systematically in the DSA practice branch.
