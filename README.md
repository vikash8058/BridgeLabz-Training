# Week 4 : Collection Interface

## 📅 Day 1 – Java Collections: Deep Dive into Generics
**(Date: 15-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Understanding Generics for Type-Safe Collections)**

- > Studied Java Generics in detail to understand how they provide type safety and reduce runtime errors in collections.

- > Learned how generic classes, methods, and interfaces work with collections like List, Set, and Map.

- > Explored bounded type parameters, wildcards (? extends, ? super), and their use cases.

- > Understood how generics improve code reusability, readability, and compile-time checking.

- > Focused on applying generics effectively to write clean, robust, and maintainable collection-based code.

## 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework: List, Set, Queue & Map
**(Date: 16-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Complete Overview of Java Collections Framework)**

- > Studied the Java Collections Framework in depth, covering List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces.

- > Explored List implementations such as ArrayList and LinkedList for ordered and index-based data storage.

- > Learned Set implementations like HashSet and TreeSet to handle unique elements and sorted collections.

- > Understood Queue and Deque implementations for FIFO processing and task scheduling.

- > Studied Map implementations such as HashMap and TreeMap for efficient key–value data storage and retrieval.

- > Focused on choosing the right collection type based on performance, ordering, and use-case requirements.
