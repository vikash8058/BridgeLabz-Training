- Learned basic Git commands (`init`, `branch`, `checkout`, `add`, `commit`, `push`).
- Successfully pushed files to the remote repository.

## 📅 Day 2 – Git Practice & Basic Java Programs   
**(Date: 16-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Writing Clean & Professional Java Code)**

- Practiced Git workflow to understand commits and version control.
- Solved very basic Java programs to understand syntax and structure.
- Practiced adding, committing, and pushing Java files to GitHub.

- Started writing Java code in a **professional and industry-standard manner**, following:
  - Proper **naming conventions** (class names, variables, methods)
  - Clean and readable **indentation**
  - Meaningful **comments** for better understanding
  - Structured and consistent **code formatting**

- Gained hands-on experience in organizing programs for better **maintainability and readability**.

- All practice programs were stored systematically under the `program-prerequisite` module.

## 📅 Day 3 – Java Programming Elements
**(Date: 17-Dec-2025)**
- Studied Java programming elements:
  - Variables and data types
  - Operators
  - User input and output
- Solved practice problems based on programming elements.
- Committed and pushed solutions to the repository.

## 📅 Day 4 – Control Flows  
**(Date: 18-Dec-2025)**
**(Logic Building with Conditional & Looping Constructs)**

- Worked on **Java Control Flow statements** to strengthen logical thinking.
- Practice problems were categorized into **three levels**:
  - **Level 1**: Basic conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`)
  - **Level 2**: Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
  - **Level 3**: Combined logic-based and pattern-oriented problems

- Emphasized writing **clean, readable, and structured code**.
- All programs were organized under the `control-flow` folder in `gcr-codebase`.

## 📅 Day 5 – Java Arrays 
**(Date:19-Dec-2025)**
**(Data Storage & Manipulation Techniques)**

- Learned and practiced **Java Arrays** for handling collections of data.
- Problems were divided into **two levels**:
  - **Level 1**: Basic array creation, traversal, and input/output
  - **Level 2**: Logical problems such as searching, counting, and data manipulation

- Followed proper **coding standards** with consistent indentation and naming conventions.
- Programs were stored under the `arrays` folder in `gcr-codebase`.

## 📅 Day 6 – Java Methods 
**(Date: 20-Dec-2025)**

- Practiced **Java Methods** to understand modular and reusable code design.
- Problems were categorized into **three levels**:
  - **Level 1**: Simple method creation and invocation
  - **Level 2**: Methods with parameters and return values
  - **Level 3**: Logical problems using multiple methods

- Added a new **`methods`** folder inside `gcr-codebase`.

## 📅 Day 7– Java Strings 
**(Date: 22-Dec-2025)**

- Worked on **Java String concepts** and operations.
- Practice problems were divided into **three levels**, focusing on:
  - String creation and comparison
  - Character-level operations
  - Logical string-based problems

- Added a new **`strings`** folder inside `gcr-codebase`.

## 📅 Day 8 – Extras & Advanced Practice  
**(Date: 23-Dec-2025)**
**(Extended Java Concepts & Built-in Features)**

- Worked on **additional Java practice programs** beyond core concepts.
- Created a new **`extras`** folder inside `gcr-codebase`.
- Practiced problems related to:
  - **String Handling** (advanced string operations)
  - **Date & Time** (using Java Date-Time API)
