## 📅 Day 9 – Java OOPS: Class & Object  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Core OOPS Fundamentals- class and objects )**

-Learned the basic concepts of Class and Object in Java.

-Understood how a class defines structure and behavior, while objects represent real-world entities.

-Practiced creating classes with variables and methods, and instantiating multiple objects.

-Gained clarity on how objects interact using method calls.

-Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-Organized all Class & Object programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

### 📅 Day 10 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts

**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Constructors, Instance Variables vs Class Variables & Methods)**

Learned the concept of Constructors in Java and understood their role in initializing objects.

Practiced creating default and parameterized constructors to assign initial values to objects.

Understood the difference between instance variables (object-specific data) and class-level (static) variables (shared data).

Implemented programs to observe how static variables maintain a common state across multiple objects.

Learned the distinction between instance methods and class (static) methods, and when to use each.

Gained clarity on accessing instance members using objects and class members using the class name.

Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting across all programs.

Organized all constructor and static concept programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.
