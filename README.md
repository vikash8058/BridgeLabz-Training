## 📅 Day 9 – Java OOPS: Class & Object  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Core OOPS Fundamentals- class and objects )**

-Learned the basic concepts of Class and Object in Java.

-Understood how a class defines structure and behavior, while objects represent real-world entities.

-Practiced creating classes with variables and methods, and instantiating multiple objects.

-Gained clarity on how objects interact using method calls.

-Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-Organized all Class & Object programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

### 📅 Day 10 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts

**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Constructors, Instance Variables vs Class Variables & Methods)**

Learned the concept of Constructors in Java and understood their role in initializing objects.

Practiced creating default and parameterized constructors to assign initial values to objects.

Understood the difference between instance variables (object-specific data) and class-level (static) variables (shared data).

Implemented programs to observe how static variables maintain a common state across multiple objects.

Learned the distinction between instance methods and class (static) methods, and when to use each.

Gained clarity on accessing instance members using objects and class members using the class name.

Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting across all programs.

Organized all constructor and static concept programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 11 – Java OOPS: Core Java Keywords ##

**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: static, final, this, instanceof)**

-> Studied essential Java keywords and their role in OOPS-based programming.

-> Understood the use of static keyword for class-level variables, methods, and shared behavior.

-> Learned how final keyword is used to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.

-> Practiced using this keyword to refer to the current object and resolve ambiguity between instance variables and parameters.

-> Gained clarity on the instanceof operator to check object type at runtime.

-> Implemented small programs to observe how these keywords affect object behavior and memory usage.

-> Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-> Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-> Organized all keyword-based programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.
