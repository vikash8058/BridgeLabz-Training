# Week 5: Java IOStreams 

## 📅 Day 1 – Java File Handling: CSV Data Processing
**(Date: 24-01-2026)**
**Focus: CSV Handling from Basics to Advanced Scenarios**

- > Practiced reading, writing, and counting records in CSV files using structured data formats.

- > Implemented filtering, searching, updating, and sorting CSV records based on business rules.

- > Worked on data validation using regex, duplicate detection, and conversion of CSV data into Java objects.

- > Handled advanced operations like merging multiple CSV files and processing large CSV files efficiently in chunks.

- > Explored real-world integrations including database-to-CSV reporting, JSON ↔ CSV conversion, and encrypting/decrypting sensitive CSV fields.
