## 📅 Day 9 – Java OOPS: Class & Object  
**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Core OOPS Fundamentals- class and objects )**

-Learned the basic concepts of Class and Object in Java.

-Understood how a class defines structure and behavior, while objects represent real-world entities.

-Practiced creating classes with variables and methods, and instantiating multiple objects.

-Gained clarity on how objects interact using method calls.

-Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-Organized all Class & Object programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

### 📅 Day 10 – Java OOPS: Constructors & Class-Level Concepts

**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Constructors, Instance Variables vs Class Variables & Methods)**

Learned the concept of Constructors in Java and understood their role in initializing objects.

Practiced creating default and parameterized constructors to assign initial values to objects.

Understood the difference between instance variables (object-specific data) and class-level (static) variables (shared data).

Implemented programs to observe how static variables maintain a common state across multiple objects.

Learned the distinction between instance methods and class (static) methods, and when to use each.

Gained clarity on accessing instance members using objects and class members using the class name.

Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting across all programs.

Organized all constructor and static concept programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 11 – Java OOPS: Core Java Keywords ##

**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: static, final, this, instanceof)**

-> Studied essential Java keywords and their role in OOPS-based programming.

-> Understood the use of static keyword for class-level variables, methods, and shared behavior.

-> Learned how final keyword is used to restrict modification of variables, methods, and classes.

-> Practiced using this keyword to refer to the current object and resolve ambiguity between instance variables and parameters.

-> Gained clarity on the instanceof operator to check object type at runtime.

-> Implemented small programs to observe how these keywords affect object behavior and memory usage.

-> Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-> Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-> Organized all keyword-based programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 12 – Java OOPS: Data Modeling & Object Relationships

**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**
***(Focus: Data Modeling, Association, Aggregation & Composition)***

-> Learned the concept of data modeling in object-oriented programming to represent real-world systems.

-> Understood different types of object relationships and how classes interact with each other.

-> Studied Association to model communication and relationships between independent objects.

-> Learned Aggregation to represent a “has-a” relationship where objects can exist independently.

-> Understood Composition as a strong form of aggregation where the lifecycle of child objects depends on the parent.

-> Practiced designing class diagrams conceptually before implementing code.

-> Implemented simple programs to demonstrate real-world examples of association, aggregation, and composition.

-> Focused on writing clean, modular, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-> Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-> Organized all data-modeling and relationship-based programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.

## 📅 Day 13 – Java OOPS: Inheritance

**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Inheritance & Code Reusability in OOPS)**

-> Learned the concept of Inheritance in Java and how it enables code reusability.

-> Understood the relationship between superclass (parent) and subclass (child).

-> Practiced single inheritance to extend properties and behaviors of a base class.

-> Learned multilevel inheritance where a class inherits from another derived class.

-> Implemented hierarchical inheritance to model multiple subclasses inheriting from a common superclass.

-> Used the extends keyword to establish inheritance relationships.

-> Understood how method overriding works in inherited classes.

-> Learned the role of the super keyword in accessing parent class constructors and methods.

-> Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured OOPS-based code.

-> Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

-> Organized all inheritance-based programs systematically in the java-oops-practice branch.
