# Week 6: Java 8 features

## 📅 Day 1 – Lambda Expression, Functional Interface, Method reference and Marker Interface
**(Date: 27-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Functional Programming Enhancements in Java 8)**

- > Studied Java 8 functional programming concepts to write cleaner, more expressive, and efficient Java code.

- > Learned Lambda Expressions to reduce boilerplate code and implement functional interfaces in a concise manner.

- > Explored Functional Interfaces such as Runnable, Callable, Comparator, and custom functional interfaces using @FunctionalInterface.

- > Practiced Method References (static, instance, and constructor references) to improve readability and reuse existing methods.

- > Understood the concept of Marker Interfaces and how they provide metadata to the JVM without defining methods.

- > Applied Java 8 features in practical examples to simplify logic, improve maintainability, and follow modern Java coding standards.

- > Focused on building a strong foundation for Streams API, collections processing, and functional-style programming.
