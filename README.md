**(Date: 15-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Understanding Generics for Type-Safe Collections)**

- > Studied Java Generics in detail to understand how they provide type safety and reduce runtime errors in collections.

- > Learned how generic classes, methods, and interfaces work with collections like List, Set, and Map.

- > Explored bounded type parameters, wildcards (? extends, ? super), and their use cases.

- > Understood how generics improve code reusability, readability, and compile-time checking.

- > Focused on applying generics effectively to write clean, robust, and maintainable collection-based code.
