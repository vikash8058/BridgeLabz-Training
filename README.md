## 📅 Day 15 – Data Structures & Algorithms: Linked List
**(Date: 02-01-2026)**
**(Focus: DSA Fundamentals – Linked List Variants)**

- > Learned the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and their importance in efficient problem-solving.

- > Understood how data structures help in organizing and managing data for optimized performance.

- > Studied Linked List as a dynamic linear data structure that uses nodes instead of contiguous memory.
  
- > Learned the structure of a node containing data and references (links).

- > Explored different types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List – traversal in one direction using next reference.

Doubly Linked List – traversal in both directions using previous and next references.

Circular Linked List – last node links back to the first node forming a loop.

- > Practiced implementing Linked Lists using Java classes and pointer-based logic.

- > Gained clarity on insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching operations.

- > Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured DSA-based code.

- > Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

- > Organized all Linked List programs systematically in the DSA practice branch.

## 📅 Day 16 – Data Structures & Algorithms: Stack, Queue & Hashing
**(Date: 03-01-2026)**
**(Focus: DSA Fundamentals – Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing)**

- > Learned the fundamentals of Stack as a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

- >Understood common Stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

- >Studied Queue as a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

- >Learned Queue operations including enqueue, dequeue, front, and rear.

- >Explored different Queue implementations and real-world use cases.

- >Studied Hashing as a technique to map data to fixed-size values for fast access.

- >Understood how HashMap stores data in key–value pairs using hashing.

- >Learned about hash functions, collision handling, and efficient searching.

- >Practiced implementing Stack, Queue, and HashMap concepts using Java.

- >Gained clarity on how these data structures improve time complexity and performance.

- >Focused on writing clean, readable, and well-structured DSA-based code.

- >Followed proper naming conventions, indentation, and consistent formatting.

- >Organized all Stack, Queue, and Hashing programs systematically in the DSA practice branch.
